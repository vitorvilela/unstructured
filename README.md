# Hybrid Lagrangian unstructured-Eulerian framework
Adaptive, unstructured mesh, 2D framework for thermal-fluid flow simulations focuses on particle transport

USES:
- Triangle: Engineering a 2D Quality Mesh Generator and Delaunay Triangulator
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.research.html
- Uthash: A hash table for C structures
https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/

TODO:
- Correct fluxes based on cell face projection
- Include fluid transport
- Include thermal-fluid flow coupling
- Add particle transport
- Adaptive mesh
